# More Interestingness

## Summary

This is a chrome extension which loads a new interesting photo from flickr's interestingness stream (http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting) whenever you open a new tab a new.

Clicking on the flickr user's icon will take you to that user's page, clicking on the title will take you to the photo on flickr.com

You can navigate forward/backwards by clicking out of the address bar and typing j to go forward, or k to go backwards (standard vim up/down)


## Ideas

 * look at time spent on page to show more hn/twitter/... comments on urls that
   the user is interested in?
 * instead of disappearing have a muted section at the bottom of recently
   visited pages?
 * include photos from instagram contacts
 * include photos from facebook
 * include urls mentioned by twitter contacts (use longurl.org to expand)
 * background updates?
