Whenever you open a new tab a new interesting photo is displayed. This extension keeps an up-to-date list of the most recent photos on Flickr.com that are in the interestingness stream - http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting  

Clicking on the flickr user's icon will take you to that user's page, clicking on the title will take you to the photo on flickr.com

You can navigate forward/backwards by clicking out of the address bar and typing j to go forward, or k to go backwards (standard vim up/down)
